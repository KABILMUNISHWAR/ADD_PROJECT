            <h2>My Rajasthan Experience</h2>
            <p>My journey through Rajasthan was truly unforgettable. I started in Jaipur, where I marveled at the Amber Fort and took a camel ride through the city's markets. The Hawa Mahal, with its beautiful lattice windows, was a highlight, offering a glimpse of the royal past. I then traveled to Udaipur, where I enjoyed a boat ride on Lake Pichola, with the City Palace standing majestically in the background.</p>
            <p>In Jodhpur, I explored Mehrangarh Fort, which offered panoramic views of the city, including the famous blue houses. The atmosphere in Jaisalmer was entirely different as I wandered through the Golden Fort and explored the desert on a camel ride, watching the sun set over the vast sands. Rajasthan’s rich culture, architecture, and hospitality made each stop on my trip memorable.</p>
