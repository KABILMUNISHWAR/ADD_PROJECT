            <h2>My Experience at Amber Fort</h2>
            <p>Visiting Amber Fort was like stepping into a page of history. As I walked through the grand gates and past the massive walls, I was amazed by the architectural beauty. The fort is a perfect blend of Hindu and Mughal architecture, with intricate carvings, ornate decorations, and expansive courtyards. The panoramic views of the surrounding hills and the Maota Lake were breathtaking.</p>
            <p>The highlight of my visit was the Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), which is an absolute marvel. The entire palace is adorned with mirrors that create a mesmerizing effect, especially when lit. The sound and light show in the evening adds another layer of magic to the experience.</p>
